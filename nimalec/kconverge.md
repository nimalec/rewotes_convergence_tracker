# K-point convergence tracker (Materials)
To do:
 1. Make classes for scf input files to allow for parameter sweep
 2. add identifier of symmetry to determine how to sweep over relevant parametes
 3. Make class for run scripts
 4. Make function to determine parallelization schemes
 5. Make work flow class: make director -> add files to director --> run scripts in directory --> extract output
 6. Incorporate the above into 'KConverge' class
 7. Make helper function for jobs to run in the background  
 8. While loop runs over to check for energy convergence     
 9. Output k mesh and threhold achieved at the end of run.     
 10. come up with a list of materials to test.
